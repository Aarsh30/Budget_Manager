## GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered coding assistant that integrates with Visual Studio Code (VS Code). It provides intelligent code suggestions and completions as you write code, helped me in writing  faster and reducing the need for manual typing. Copilot leverages machine learning models trained on vast amounts of code to generate context-aware code snippets. Simply install the GitHub Copilot extension in VS Code, and it will provide suggestions and autocompletions based on your current coding context.

It is is useful for writing code as it saves you time and effort by providing intelligent code suggestions and completions in real-time. It can help you quickly generate boilerplate code, complete complex expressions, and suggest relevant functions or methods based on the context. Copilot can be particularly beneficial when working with unfamiliar libraries or languages, as it offers guidance and reduces the need for extensive searching and referencing documentation. Ultimately, it enhances your coding productivity and helps streamline the development process.
